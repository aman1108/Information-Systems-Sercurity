Assignment #4: Lab on PCAP Analysis (4th Jan 2021) 
In this assignment, we will complete our work with reading and reviewing PCAPs as it is  
essential for a security analyst to understand how to do this and to be very familiar with  
Wireshark. Additionally, students will set up a honeypot in their Kali Linux installation. 

Part #1 
Situation: A Very Special One 
Students should: 
1. Download this PCAP file from Classwork. 
2. Review the sample analysis discussing these questions: 
∙ Document the date, start time and end time of the pcap in UTC (GMT). 
∙ Document the IP address of the three hosts in the pcap. 
∙ Document the mac address of the three hosts in the pcap. 
∙ Document the type of computer (Windows, Mac, Android, etc) for each of the three hosts in the pcap. 
∙ Determine which host(s) were infected. 
∙ Document the family (or families) of malware based on indicators from the pcap. 
∙ Document the root cause for any infections noted in the pcap. 

Complete a 1 page reflection for Part #1. Given these sample incident reports, 
write about  what you learned, what you have questions about, what you researched as part of this  
review, and anything else you feel is relevant. Later in the course, you will be asked to  
complete an incident report on a given PCAP but this project is meant to mature the  
exercise of packet analysis and incident reporting. 

Part #2 
In Part #2 this assignment, students are to follow the guidance in your book and in the  
video below on how to create a honeypot within Kali Linux. Students should provide  
screen shots as needed showing the setup process of the honeypot and that the honeypot  
is working. Finally, students should write about what you learned in this part.
