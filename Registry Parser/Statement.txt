Assignment #1 (10th Dec 2020)

Extract the SYSTEM and SOFTWARE hives from your Windows system. (Hint:
look in /Windows/System32/Config). You can use any Registry parser (E.g.
Registry Ripper/Registry Explorer) and then select the appropriate hive file to
answer these questions (put a snapshot for each answer):
1. What is the computer name of the system?
2. When was the Operating System installed?
3. What are the applications installed on the system?
4. What date/time (in UTC) was the Operating System installed? Hint: you may
have to convert epoch time to human readable time using DCode tool.
5. Is Remote Desktop service enabled? How do you know?
6. What is the IP address of the system?
7. When was the system last shutdown?
